# CSS Advanced – SmileSchool Homepage

This project is part of the ALX Frontend Web Development program, under the **CSS Advanced** module.  
The goal of the project is to recreate a full landing page from a Figma design using only HTML and CSS.

The HTML structure was originally provided for this project, but instead of using the given file, I chose to code the entire HTML from scratch using the wireframe as my guide.

## Project Overview

The page represents a fictional platform called **SmileSchool**, and it contains several sections such as:

- A navigation header with a logo and links
- A banner section with a bold title, call-to-action button and a "Learn from the pros" block showcasing instructors
- A testimonial section
- A video section showcasing anlist of popular tutorials with ratings
- A membership section
- A FAQ section
- A footer section

The entire page was styled using advanced CSS techniques to ensure the structure and visual hierarchy match the Figma layout.

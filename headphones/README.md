🎧 Headphones – ALX Frontend Web Development Project

This project is part of the ALX Frontend Web Development curriculum.
The goal is to recreate a fully functional, responsive webpage from scratch, based entirely on a Figma design by Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX Designer).

No external libraries, no JavaScript — just pure HTML and CSS.
